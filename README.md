# 🐍 Python Mastery Labs

Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository is a collection of hands-on exercises and scripts that I've developed while mastering Python fundamentals and advanced concepts.

## 📂 Structure

| File | Level | Key Concepts Covered |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`python_data_essentials.py`** | 🚀 Advanced | Functional Programming (`map`, `filter`, `lambda`), Advanced Logic, and List Comprehensions. |
| **`list_methods.py`** | Intermediate | Deep dive into List operations: `append`, `extend`, `insert`, `pop`, and `clear`. |
| **`data_labs.py`** |  Basics | Fundamentals of Python: Strings, Tuples, Slicing, and Basic Indexing. |
| **`datetime_mastery.py`** | 🕒 Time & Dates | Timezones (`pytz`), `timedelta`, `strftime`, `strptime` |
| **`oop_concepts.py`** | 🏛️ Advanced | Object-Oriented Programming: Classes, `__init__`, and Methods. |
| **`oop_parking.py`** | 🏛️ Advanced | Object-Oriented Programming: Classes, `__init__`, and Methods. |
| **`oop_Employee.py`** | 🏛️ Advanced | Object-Oriented Programming: Classes, `__init__`, and Methods. |
| `sets_manipulation.py` | Basics | Mastery of Set theory: `add`, `remove`, `union (|)`, `intersection (&)`, and `difference (-)`. |



## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Advanced Iterables:** Mastering `zip()`, `enumerate()`, and `range()` for efficient looping.
* **Functional Tools:** Practical application of `lambda` functions with `filter` and `map`.
* **Data Integrity:** Understanding the difference between mutable (Lists) and immutable (Tuples) structures.
* **Version Control:** Managing code updates and commits via **Git**.
* **Time Management:** Handling real-world dates and global timezones.
